      <h3>About <a href="/">Jeopardy</a></h3>

      <p>Hello there!</p>

      <p>This project was created because of the author's insistance that there aren't good pieces of software that help
      in editing and playing Jeopardy, either in person or with a shared screen (MS PPT is doable, but a hassle to set
      up and not free).</p>

      <p>If you see something wrong, or want to request features, please submit your concerns 
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/chucksys/jeopardy-vue/issues">here</a>. If you are interested in the code, you will
      find it <a href="https://gitlab.com/chucksys/jeopardy-vue/">here</a>.</p>
